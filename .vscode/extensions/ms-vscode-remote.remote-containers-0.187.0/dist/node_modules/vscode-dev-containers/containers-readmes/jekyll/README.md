In addition to Ruby and Bundler, this development container installs Jekyll and the required tools at startup:

- If your Jekyll project contains a `Gemfile` in the root folder, the development container will install all gems at startup by running `bundle install`. This is the [recommended](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/step-by-step/10-deployment/#gemfile) approach as it allows you to specify the exact Jekyll version your project requires and list all additional Jekyll plugins.
- If there's no `Gemfile`, the development container will install Jekyll automatically, picking the latest version. You might need to manually install the other dependencies your project relies on, including all relevant Jekyll plugins.

## Using this definition

1. If this is your first time using a development container, please see getting started information on [setting up](https://aka.ms/vscode-remote/containers/getting-started) Remote-Containers or [creating a codespace](https://aka.ms/ghcs-open-codespace) using GitHub Codespaces.

2. Start VS Code and open your project folder or connect to a codespace.

3. Press <kbd>F1</kbd> select and **Add Development Container Configuration Files...** command for **Remote-Containers** or **Codespaces**.

   > **Note:** If needed, you can drag-and-drop the `.devcontainer` folder from this sub-folder in a locally cloned copy of this repository into the VS Code file explorer instead of using the command.

4. Select this definition. You may also need to select **Show All Definitions...** for it to appear.

5. Finally, press <kbd>F1</kbd> and run **Remote-Containers: Reopen Folder in Container** or **Codespaces: Rebuild Container** to start using the definition.
